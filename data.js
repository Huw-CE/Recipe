      "2 egg yolks",
      "3 tablespoons finely grated pecorino (pepato or romano), plus extra to serve",
      "225 g quality dried spaghetti",
      "freshly ground pepper"
    ],
    method: `Remove the skin from the guanciale (reserving it for the stock), then cut the guanciale into 5 mm (1/4 inch) dice.

Bring 400 ml (14 fl oz) of the chicken stock to the boil and add the reserved guanciale skin, along with any parmesan rinds you may have, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. You don't want the stock to reduce too much, so cook it over very low heat. You should end up with about 250 ml (1 cup) - make up this amount with more stock, if needed.

Put the diced guanciale into a frying pan over very low heat and cook slowly until all the fat is rendered and it becomes very crispy - this could take up to 15 minutes.

In the meantime, use a whisk or stick blender to mix the egg yolks and pecorino into the warm stock mixture until emulsified.

Once the guanciale is done, use a slotted spoon to remove the crisp guanciale and set aside. Strain the rendered fat into the egg yolk mixture and whisk or blend again, then pour back into the frying pan and keep warm.

Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on the package.

Drain the pasta and add to the frying pan, then toss until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta. Grind in a generous amount of pepper, add the crisp guanciale and toss another couple of times - you may need to adjust the consistency with a little more stock.

Divide between warmed bowls and serve with more grated pecorino.`

    time: "1 hr 15 mins",
    category: "Salads",
    ingredients: [
      "50 g sorghum - optional",
      "200 g stracciatella",
      "1/2 head of radicchio, really thinly sliced",
      "sea salt",
      "75 g raisins",
      "25 ml white wine vinegar",
      "1 tablespoon caster (superfine) sugar",
      "0.25 g (3/4 teaspoon) saffron threads",
      "80 ml white wine vinegar",
      "50 ml vegetable oil",
      "50 ml olive oil"
    ],
    method: `For the pickled raisins, put the raisins into a heatproof bowl. In a small non-aluminium pan, bring the vinegar, sugar and 50 ml (1 1/2 fl oz) of water to the boil, then pour it over the raisins and let them soak, covered, for about an hour. Transfer the raisins, with their soaking liquid, to a food processor and blend into a puree.

For the saffron dressing, put the saffron and vinegar into a small non-aluminium pan with 125 ml (1/2 cup) of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil, then simmer until reduced by two-thirds - you should be left with about 2 1/2 tablespoons. Let the saffron reduction cool to room temperature, then slowly drizzle in the oils, while blending with a stick blender or hand whisk to emulsify.

If using sorghum, cook it in a pan of lightly boiling salted water until tender, about an hour, then drain well.

To serve, put the stracciatella into a bowl and generously dress with most of the saffron dressing, then spoon the raisins and sorghum over the top. Dress the radicchio with the remaining saffron dressing and a pinch of salt, then use to cover the stracciatella.`

    title: "Fermented mushroom risotto",
    author: "Andreas Papadakis",
    book: "Tipo 00",
    serves: "4",
    time: "6 days",
    category: "Risotto",
    ingredients: [
      "2 large shallots, finely chopped",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil",
      "320 g Vialone Nano rice",
      "80 ml white vermouth, such as Cocci Americano, or white wine",
      "100 g cold unsalted butter, diced",
      "125 g finely grated parmesan",
      "sea salt",
      "500 g field mushrooms, coarsely chopped",
      "2 large shallots, coarsely chopped",
      "2 teaspoons thyme leaves",
      "2 litres chicken or vegetable stock"
    ],
    method: `For the stock, lightly sprinkle the mushrooms with salt and leave in a warm place in the kitchen for a few hours, preferably overnight. This draws out the juices from the mushrooms and helps to oxidise them, intensifying their flavour.

Put the mushrooms, shallot and thyme into a stockpot or large saucepan, then pour in the stock. Bring to a simmer and cook over low heat for 1 1/2 hours, then take off the heat, cover and let it rest for 30 minutes. Strain the stock through a colander and squeeze the mushrooms to extract as much liquid as possible - you should have about 1-1.5 litres (4-6 cups). Store your stock in the fridge, where it will last well for up to a week, or freeze for longer storage. Keep the mushrooms aside for fermenting.

To lacto-ferment the mushrooms, you will need to weigh them, then make a brine using 2 per cent of the mushrooms' weight in salt - so, if the mushrooms weigh 300 g (10 1/2 oz), you'll need to dissolve 6 g (1/8 oz) of sea salt in 1 litre (4 cups) of filtered or bottled water. Pack the mushrooms into a sterilised 500 ml (2 cup) jar, then pour in enough of the brine to completely cover the mushrooms. Put the lid on the jar and leave at room temperature, away from sunlight, for 4-7 days, briefly opening the lid each day to allow any gases to escape. (If you have a vacuum sealer, you can use that to ferment the mushrooms instead: just seal the mushrooms in a bag with 2 per cent of their weight in salt - you will see that it's working once the bag starts filling up with air.)

After 4 days, taste a little of the ferment each day to check on its progress, resealing and leaving for longer, if needed. When it has reached the desired strength of flavour, strain off the liquid, transfer the fermented mushrooms to a blender or food processor and pulse to a coarsely chopped paste. (If you're not using it right away, the paste can be kept in the fridge for up to 6 months.)

When you're ready to make the risotto, bring your mushroom stock to the boil and keep warm. Place a wide pan over medium-low heat and saute the shallot in the olive oil until translucent. Add the rice and lightly toast for 2 minutes, then pour in the vermouth or wine and let it evaporate completely. Continue to cook the rice, adding the stock one ladle at a time and stirring every couple of minutes.

When almost all of the stock has been absorbed, about 15 minutes in, the rice should be 90 per cent cooked. If not, add some more stock or water and cook it for a little longer - you want the rice to have a good bite without being crunchy.

Now proceed with the 'mantecatura' (to make the risotto creamy), stirring in the cold butter one piece at a time. Once that's done, stir in 2 tablespoons of your fermented mushroom paste, then add the parmesan a handful at a time and keep stirring until the risotto is creamy and smooth. If it seems dry, add a little more stock or water. Check for seasoning, but you shouldn't need any as the fermented mushrooms are quite salty.

Serve the risotto in warmed shallow bowls.`

    time: "1 hr 15 mins",
    category: "Seafood",
    ingredients: [
      "225 g quality dried spaghetti - or 1/2 quantity master pasta dough",
      "30 cm piece of rainbow trout, cut into strips 30 cm long and 2 mm wide",
      "50 g fine salt",
      "25 g white sugar",
      "2 rainbow trout fillets, skinned and pin-boned",
      "1 tablespoon olive oil",
      "1 clove of garlic",
      "1 sprig of thyme",
      "500 g mussels, scrubbed and de-bearded",
      "50 ml dry white wine",
      "60 g unsalted butter",
      "3 anchovy fillets",
      "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds",
      "250 g ripe Black Russian tomatoes, grated on a box grater",
      "1 clove of garlic, finely chopped",
      "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds",
      "1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes",
      "olive oil",
      "squeeze of lemon juice",
      "sea salt",
      "sea herbs, such as purslane, samphire or seablite, if available"
    ],
    method: `To cure the rainbow trout, first make a brine by bringing 500 ml (2 cups) of water, the salt and sugar to the boil and stirring until dissolved. Put the brine in the fridge until completely cold, then submerge the trout in it for 45 minutes, drain and pat dry.

To steam the mussels, place a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, garlic, thyme, mussels and wine all at once, covering with a lid straightaway to create steam. Cook until the mussels are just open, 2-3 minutes. Pick the mussels out of their shells, then strain the juices through a fine sieve and reserve for the tomato butter.

For the tomato butter, melt the butter with the anchovies and fennel seeds in a saucepan over low heat. Once the anchovies start to break down, add the grated tomatoes and reserved mussel juices. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 45 minutes over the lowest possible heat, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't catch on the bottom. Let it cool for 10 minutes, then blend with a stick blender until smooth. Pass through a sieve and set aside.

To finish, place a large frying pan over medium-low heat. Saute the garlic, fennel seeds and chilli flakes in a little olive oil until the garlic is translucent. Add the mussels and tomato butter and bring to a simmer.

Preheat the oven to 70C (158F) fan-forced. Generously dress the trout fillets with olive oil and heat in the oven for 5-6 minutes until just warm.

In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on the package for dried, or 3-4 minutes for fresh.

Drain the pasta and add to the frying pan, toss together for 1 minute, then add the lemon juice and taste for salt.

Divide the spaghetti between warmed bowls, placing a trout fillet on top of each one. Finish with some local sea herbs, if you have them.`

    book: "Tipo 00",
    serves: "4",
    time: "1 hr 40 mins",
    category: "Pasta",
    ingredients: [
      "300 g '00' flour",
      "100 g wholemeal flour",
      "1 teaspoon sea salt",
      "1 tablespoon olive oil",
      "1 teaspoon chilli flakes",
      "2 teaspoons fennel seeds",
      "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds",
      "100 g anchovy fillets",
      "150 ml olive oil",
      "2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced",
      "2 x 400 g tins of peeled tomatoes, preferably Italian",
      "40 g capers",
      "60 g mixed olive cheeks",
      "4 tablespoons finely grated pecorino"
    ],
    method: `However, this dough is also easy to mix by hand. In a large bowl, combine both flours and the salt. Make a well in the centre and pour in 200 g (7 oz) of water. With a fork, slowly mix the water with the flour until it has a crumble-like consistency. Add the olive oil, then transfer the dough to a clean work surface and knead with your palms, pushing forward and folding, until the dough is elastic and smooth but not too soft, about 10 minutes.

Wrap the dough really tightly in plastic film or reusable food wrap and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. I find it better to use this dough on the same day it's made.

To shape the fusilli, on a lightly floured workbench or wooden board, cut off a piece of dough and roll it into a long, skinny log about 5 mm (1/4 inch) thick, then cut 4-5 cm (1 1/2-2 inches) long strips off the log. Place your ferretto (or knitting needle or skewer) at a 45-degree angle on one of the long sides of the strip and slowly roll forward, lightly pressing evenly on both sides of the ferretto. When the spiral is complete, gently pull it away from the ferretto and place on a flour-dusted surface. Repeat until all the fusilli are shaped, then leave to dry for 1-2 hours.

For the puttanesca sauce, place a heavy-based saucepan over medium-low heat and toast the chilli flakes, fennel seeds and coriander seeds for 3-4 minutes, watching them carefully as they can quickly burn. Add the anchovies and their oil, together with the olive oil and garlic, and cook over the lowest possible heat until the anchovies break down, then add the tomatoes and cook, still over the lowest possible heat, for 1 hour. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve and discard all the seeds - you should have an intense, oily sauce.

Cook the fusilli in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, about 3-4 minutes, depending on how long the pasta has been drying for.

In the meantime, to finish, place a large frying pan over medium-low heat and warm the capers and olive cheeks for 2-3 minutes. Add the sauce and bring to a simmer.

Drain the pasta and add to the frying pan, then toss thoroughly, making sure the fusilli are well coated with the sauce. Stir in the pecorino and taste for salt.

Serve in warmed bowls.`

Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic, chilli and sage and cook for 1-2 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn't get too dark. Pour in the wine, scraping to deglaze the pan, and simmer until it has almost completely evaporated.

In the meantime, cook the casarecce in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on the package.

To finish, pour a ladle of the boiling pasta water over the sausage mixture, then add the radicchio and cook for 1 minute, just to soften it a little.

      "handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves",
      "35 g finely grated parmesan",
      "40 g thinly shaved pecorino pepato"
    ],
    method: `For the duck ragu, take the duck legs out of the fridge about an hour beforehand, season with salt and allow to come to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 150C (300F) fan-forced.

Place a large heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. When it is hot, add the duck legs, skin side down, to render the fat, and cook until golden brown, about 5-6 minutes. Turn the legs over and cook on the other side for 2 minutes, then transfer to an ovenproof braising pan.

Next add the carrot, onion and garlic to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until soft, about 3-4 minutes.

Using a slotted spoon, gently lift out the soaked porcini, disturbing the liquid as little as possible - if any dirt has been dislodged from the mushrooms by the soaking liquid, you want it to fall to the bottom (reserve the liquid for later). Coarsely chop the porcini and add to the pan. Cook for 3 minutes, then add the tomato paste and let it caramelise for 2 minutes. Pour in the wine, stirring to deglaze, then simmer until reduced to a thick paste. Carefully add three-quarters of the mushroom liquid, leaving behind any grit or dirt, then add the stock and herbs, bring to the boil and season with salt.

Pour the contents of the frying pan over the duck legs, cover really tightly with a lid or foil and cook in the oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat falls off the bone.

Meanwhile, for the gnocchi, wash the potatoes and put them into a pan of cold salted water. Bring to the boil, then simmer until tender (about 40 minutes), and drain. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins and discard. Pass the peeled potatoes through a drum sieve, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to cool completely.

Weigh out 1 kg (2 lb 4 oz) of the potato and mix with the other gnocchi ingredients until you have a smooth dough. Take care not to overwork. Divide the dough into six balls. Working with one ball at a time, roll on a lightly floured surface to form a log 1.5 cm (5/8 inch) wide, then cut into pieces 1.5 cm (5/8 inch) long. Repeat with the remaining dough.

Cook a third of the gnocchi in plenty of boiling salted water until they rise to the surface, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the gnocchi to a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking, then drain and lightly oil them, so they don't stick together. (The rest of the gnocchi - if left uncooked - can be kept in the freezer for up to a month and cooked from frozen.)

Remove the ragu from the oven, uncover, and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Take the duck legs out of the liquid and, when cool enough to handle, pick the meat off the bones in big chunks, discarding the skin, bones and herb stalks. Return the meat to the ragu and stir well.

To finish, put a third of the ragu into a large frying pan and bring to a simmer before stirring through the butter and parsley.

Re-heat the gnocchi in boiling water until they float, then drain and add to the frying pan. Toss them with the ragu for 30 seconds, then add the parmesan and toss for another 30 seconds until the ragu has emulsified.

Serve in warmed bowls, with the thinly shaved pecorino pepato.`

    method: `Preheat the oven to 150-160C (300-315F) fan-forced.

For the rabbit ragu, season the rabbit with salt and dust lightly in flour. Place a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat and saute the rabbit pieces in the olive oil. Cook until golden brown on all sides, then transfer to an ovenproof braising pan.

Next add the onion, carrot and garlic to the saucepan and cook for 4-5 minutes until the onion is soft and translucent, then add the olives and tomato paste and cook over low heat for 2 minutes. Pour in the wine and stir to deglaze, then simmer until reduced by half. Add the stock and oregano, bring to a simmer and season with salt.

Pour the contents of the saucepan over the rabbit, cover really tightly with foil and cook in the oven for 1-1 1/2 hours, or until the meat of the back legs is falling off the bone.

Let the rabbit cool down in the ragu, then lift out and pull the meat off the bones, being careful to remove all the small bones. Return the rabbit meat to the ragu and let it rest for at least 30 more minutes.

    time: "1 hr 10 mins",
    category: "Pasta",
    ingredients: [
      "1 quantity master pasta dough, rolled into sheets 2-3 mm thick",
      "1 quantity basic tomato sauce (see page 219)",
      "225 g eggplants (aubergines)",
      "125 g fresh ricotta",
      "50 g finely grated parmesan",
      "finely grated zest of 1 lemon",
      "1 tablespoon olive oil",
      "sea salt and freshly ground pepper",
      "4 tablespoons smoked ricotta salata, or grated parmesan, or olive oil, or fresh basil leaves"
    ],
    method: `For the cannelloni, lay out the pasta sheets on a lightly floured workbench or wooden board and cut a 9 cm (3 1/4 inch) square, using a ruler if you roll it around your rolling pin the edges should naturally overlap by 3-4 cm (depending on how much you adjust the size of the square, based on the thickness of your rolling pin). Once you get the size right, cut the pasta sheets into squares.

Lightly brush the front edge of a pasta square with water and wrap it around the rolling pin, pressing down firmly where the two edges meet. Gently pull the cannelloni off the rolling pin and place it upright on the work surface so it holds its shape. Repeat until all the cannelloni are made, then leave to dry for several hours, preferably overnight.

For the filling, preheat the barbecue or grill to medium-high. Cook the eggplants whole, turning every 5 minutes, until the skin is burned and the flesh is cooked all the way through - this should take around 30 minutes, depending on their size. When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh, discarding the burned skins and stems. Strain off any excess moisture. You should have 175 g (about 3/4 cup) eggplant flesh. Put this in a mixing bowl and mix well with the ricotta, parmesan, lemon zest, olive oil, salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 190C (375F) fan-forced.

The easiest way to fill the cannelloni is with a piping bag, but you can use a teaspoon. Only fill them about 90 per cent full, or the filling will come out of the pasta in the oven.

Pour two-thirds of the tomato sauce into a baking dish that just holds your filled cannelloni snugly spreading it out evenly. Place the cannelloni on top, arranging them side by side, then pour the rest of the sauce over. Sprinkle with the parmesan, cover with foil and cook in the oven for 15 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Finish with the ricotta salata and a drizzle of basil oil.`

      "2 tablespoons smoking chips",
      "2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves",
      "olive oil",
      "sea salt"
    ],
    method: `To purge the clams of sand and silt, leave them to soak in a bowl of lightly salted cold water for 2 hours.

In the meantime, for the smoked cherry tomatoes, preheat the oven to 90C (194F) fan-forced. Remove the skins of the tomatoes by blanching them in water kept at a rolling boil for 20 seconds, then use your fingers or a small knife to peel off the skins. Put the peeled tomatoes into a small baking dish, pour in the olive oil and season with salt, then cook in the oven for 1 1/2 hours - during this time, the tomatoes should shrink to half their size, get darker and become more concentrated in flavour.

Remove the tomatoes from the oven to smoke them. If you have a smoking gun, inject smoke from the smoking chips directly into the dish of tomatoes, cover with foil and leave the tomatoes to absorb the smoke for 20 minutes, then repeat one more time. If you don't have a smoking gun, light half of the smoking chips in a small metal container and, as soon as the flame subsides and the chips start smoking, carefully put the metal container into the dish with the tomatoes, cover and leave to smoke for 20 minutes, then repeat with the other half of the smoking chips.

To cook the clams, place a large frying pan over medium heat and fry the garlic and chilli in the olive oil until the garlic is translucent, about 1 minute. Add the clams and wine, cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the clams are just open. Add the tomatoes and half the basil and cook for 3 more minutes, then season with salt to taste.

Cook the linguine in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on the package for dried, or about 3-4 minutes for fresh.

Drain the pasta (reserving some of the pasta water) and add to the frying pan, then toss for 1 minute before adding the parsley and the remaining basil. Taste for salt, then toss again until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta, adding some of the reserved pasta water, if needed.

For the sauce, place a saucepan over medium heat, add half the olive oil and the reserved prawn heads and shells and cook really well for 5-6 minutes, stirring so they colour evenly. Add the herbs and Napoli tomato sauce and bring to a slow simmer. Add the remaining olive oil, cover the pan with a lid and cook the sauce over the lowest possible heat for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't catch on the bottom. Pass through a colander with large holes, pushing with the back of a ladle to squeeze the juices out of the prawn heads.

Strip the leaves of the cavolo nero from the stalks and discard the stalks. Wash the leaves and coarsely chop into large pieces, then blanch in boiling salted water for 2 minutes. Drain well and set aside.

To cook the prawns, place a frying pan over medium-low heat. Season the prawns with salt, drizzle with olive oil and cook for 1 minute on each side until just cooked. Remove from the pan and keep warm.

To finish, in the same frying pan, briefly saute the garlic and chilli in olive oil. Deglaze with the wine and simmer until reduced by half, then add the sauce and cavolo nero and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and cook for 2 minutes.

In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on the package for dried, or 3-4 minutes for fresh.

Drain the spaghetti (reserving some of the pasta water) and add to the sauce. Remove from the heat and toss for 1 minute to coat the pasta. Add the lemon juice and season with salt, if needed, then add just enough of the reserved pasta water to achieve the perfect sauce consistency and toss again. Divide the spaghetti and sauce between warmed bowls. Briefly return the prawns to the frying pan, just to warm them through in the residual heat and coat them with the pan juices. Serve on top of the spaghetti and garnish with fennel fronds, if you like.`

    title: "Master pasta dough",
    author: "Andreas Papadakis",
    book: "Tipo 00",
    serves: "4-6",
    time: "1 hr plus resting",
    category: "Basics",
    ingredients: [
      "350 g '00' flour",
      "150 g durum wheat semolina flour",
      "1 teaspoon sea salt",
      "65 g egg yolk (from about 3-4 eggs)",
      "190 g whole egg (about 4 eggs)"
    ],
    method: `If using an electric mixer, place both flours and the salt in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Make a well in the centre and add the egg yolk and whole egg. (I find it easiest to weigh the egg yolks in a clean bowl first and then add the whole eggs to the same bowl up to the total amount of eggs, which is 255 g (9 oz) for this recipe. The total amount of egg is the important part.) Mix on slow speed for 8-10 minutes, until you start seeing large crumbs forming and the dough starts coming together. Transfer the dough to a clean benchtop and knead by hand until it comes together. Don't expect it to be really smooth, as this is a drier dough - it will come together more and get smoother in the rolling process.

To make the dough by hand, combine both flours and the salt in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the egg yolk and whole egg. Mix with a fork until just combined, then transfer to a clean benchtop and knead by hand for 6-8 minutes until the dough comes together.

If the dough seems too dry and won't come together, you can spray it a couple of times with your spray bottle of water - just be careful not to overdo it and make the dough too wet, since it will become more hydrated and softer as it rests.

I like to shape the dough into a roughly rectangular block, rather than a ball, as I find it easier to feed through the pasta machine later. Wrap your dough really well in plastic film, making it as airtight as possible (at the restaurant we use a vacuum sealer).

If you are planning to make your pasta straight away, let the dough rest for at least an hour at room temperature - but ideally refrigerate it overnight, then take it out a couple of hours before rolling and cutting to let it come back to room temperature.

To make the rolling more manageable, it's best to work with a relatively small amount of dough, so divide it in two before you start. (If you are not using all the dough at once, you can refrigerate the rest of it, tightly wrapped, for up to 3 days.)

Set up the pasta machine on a solid benchtop. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten the dough enough that it will go through the widest setting on the pasta machine, then pass it through the rollers two or three times, going down one notch each time.

Bring both sides of the dough to the centre, so they meet in the middle, then fold in half to create four layers of dough.

Roll the dough through the widest setting again, then repeat the folding and rolling process one more time - but this time bring one third of the dough into the centre, laying it over the middle third, then cover with the last third to create three layers.

Flatten the dough again, so that it will go through the widest setting on your machine, then pass it through the rollers, going down one notch at a time; it should be smooth by now and starting to become elastic. Keep going until the pasta sheets are the thickness you need: for filled pasta, you want a 1-1.5 mm (1/16 inch) thickness, and for long and short shapes, 2-3 mm (1/8 inch). (4)

For long pasta (such as spaghetti and tagliatelle), the sheets are cut into strips using the cutter attachment on your pasta machine (if it has one) or a sharp knife.

For shaped pasta (such as sarganelli), the sheets are cut into squares with a pasta wheel and then formed into shapes.

For filled pasta (such as tortelloni and ravioli), the sheets are also cut into squares or circles before being filled and sealed.

And for more rustic kinds of pasta (such as fusilli al ferretto and orecchiette), the dough is not machine-rolled into sheets at all, but simply shaped by hand.`

      "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
      "2 bay leaves",
      "2 thyme sprigs",
      "1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram",
      "5 allspice berries",
      "5 whole black peppercorns",
      "1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds (optional)"
    ],
    method: `Day 1 method: Preheat the oven to 210C (415F/Gas 6-7).

Put the hock into a large saucepan or stockpot and cover with 3 litres (102 fl oz) cold water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface at this point but leave the fat (this recipe will never receive the Heart Foundation tick of approval, so don't go acting like it will.)

Add the bay leaf, allspice and juniper berries and simmer, uncovered, for 3 hours, or until the meat is falling from the bone. Remove the hock from the stock, reserving the stock, and allow to cool. Put the stock into the refrigerator to thoroughly chill. Use your fingers to remove all the meat from the hock (this is easier if it is still a bit warm), separating and reserving any sinew or fat in the refrigerator for later use.

Meanwhile, place the pork neck in a roasting tin and cook in the oven for 15 minutes. Turn it over and cook for 10 minutes - it should be nicely browned. Reduce the oven temperature to 180C (350F/Gas 4) and cook for a further 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, allow to cool, then cover and refrigerate for later use.

Day 2 method: Put the porcini and prunes in a bowl and just cover with boiling water. Leave to soak until needed.

Blanch the cabbage in a saucepan of boiling water for 1 minute, then drain well, squeezing out and reserving the excess liquid - this will reduce any sulphurous smells during cooking. Coarsely chop the sauerkraut.

Cook the kaiserfleisch in a frying pan over medium-high heat, turning often, until it is well browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to a plate, leaving the rendered fat in the pan. Cook the Polish ring sausage until it is well browned. Remove the sausage and any fat to a plate with the kaiserfleisch.

Pick the meat from the pork neck and chop it into 1 cm (1/2 inch) dice. Cut the reserved hock meat into 1 cm (1/2 inch) dice.

Using a large metal spoon, remove the fat from the top of the chilled hock stock. Melt this in a large heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and half of the garlic and cook slowly until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the sauerkraut, cabbage, bay leaves, thyme, marjoram, allspice, peppercorns, caraway seeds, if using, hock stock, and all of the meats and their reserved fat. Cook it all over low heat for at least 3 hours, stirring often to prevent it from sticking to the base of the pan.

During the last 15 minutes of cooking, add the remaining garlic. Season with salt, black pepper and some of the reserved cabbage cooking liquid, to taste - the final result should be sweet, salty, fatty and sour in balance.`

      "1 teaspoon dried marjoram"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 130C (250F/Gas 1). In a bowl, mix together the flour, sweet and hot paprikas and the salt. Add the veal, tossing well to evenly coat the meat.

Heat half of the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the veal and cook, turning occasionally, until it is well browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer the veal to a casserole dish and set aside.

Add 60 ml (2 fl oz/1/4 cup) of the stock to the pan to deglaze, using a wooden spoon to remove any bits stuck to the base of the pan. Add more stock if necessary, then pour over the veal in the dish.

Add the remaining oil to the pan and cook the onion, carrot and celery until they are soft and the onion begins to colour. Repeat the deglazing procedure with more stock and add to the casserole along with the remaining ingredients. Cover and cook in the oven for 2 1/2-3 hours, or until the meat is very tender. Check it each hour for the first 2 hours, then every half hour - if it is sticking or burning, give it a stir and reduce the heat as required.

Of all the side dishes that go with this goulash, surely the least healthy and the most delicious are the potato blintzes - go ahead, doing what feels good right now is what Borsch is all about.`

Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion to the dish and cook, stirring frequently, until it is softened, but not browned. Add the peppercorn paste and cook, stirring, for a further few minutes, then add enough water to just cover the meat. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 2 1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender. You will need to stir the meat occasionally to prevent it sticking to the base of the dish.

When the meat is tender, mix the potato starch with 1 tablespoon of water until it is smooth. Pour into the goulash and stir to thicken. Sprinkle with a little sweet paprika, to serve.

At Borsch, we also serve goulash with a red capsicum relish (the kind where the peppers are cut into little dice) which is available prepared from Continental grocery stores and is probably labelled 'paprika relish'.`

    method: `Heat a small saucepan over medium heat, add the saffron threads and dry-toast, stirring constantly, for 10 seconds. Add the wine and simmer until the liquid reduces to 1 tablespoon. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.

Beat the butter and the saffron reduction until well combined. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.

In a large bowl, mix together the lamb, breadcrumbs, turmeric, coriander, garlic, paprika, 1 egg and tomato sauce, if using. Remove the chilled saffron butter from the refrigerator and cut it into 8 batons.

Spread about 2 tablespoons of the lamb mixture on a clean work surface. Place a portion of butter in the centre and roll the lamb mixture up to enclose the butter and form a cylinder. Repeat with the remaining butter and lamb to make 8 croquettes in total.

Put the flour, extra egg and panko into separate bowls. Gently roll the croquettes first in the flour, then dip in the egg, and roll in the panko to coat.

Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy-based saucepan to 180C (350F), or until a cube of bread dropped into the oil browns in 15 seconds. Deep-fry the croquettes, in batches, for 3-5 minutes, or until crisp. Make sure the oil is not too hot, or they will become golden without cooking all the way through.

      "375 ml beef or veal stock",
      "125 ml good-quality Italian tomato passata",
      "165 g medium-grain rice",
      "1-2 kg white cabbage, outer leaves and core removed",
      "1 onion, finely chopped",
      "300 g minced beef",
      "salt and freshly ground black pepper"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 180C (350F/Gas 4). Drain the mushrooms and reserve the soaking liquid. Squeeze the mushrooms of excess liquid, and finely chop. Set aside.

Melt the teaspoon of butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, then add the flour and stir for 2 minutes until it is thoroughly incorporated and bubbling a little bit. Slowly add the stock, a little at a time, and stir until it is well combined and starts to bubble again. When all of the stock has been used, stir in the tomato passata and the reserved porcini soaking liquid. Leave to simmer for a further 5 minutes, then remove from the heat.

Bring a medium-sized saucepan and a large saucepan of water to the boil.

Add the rice to the medium pan and stir it in. Bring back to the boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Strain and refresh in cold running water, then drain well.

Put the whole cabbage carefully into the large saucepan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. Strain carefully (it can splash) and allow to cool for a further 5 minutes. Carefully remove the leaves, being sure not to break them. When you have eight good, unbroken leaves and a couple of spares, put the core of the cabbage away - you can shred it and heat it in butter with caraway seeds later. Using a sharp knife, carefully trim the protruding ribs on the back of each cabbage leaf so that it is flush with the rest of the leaf.

Melt the extra butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until it softens. Add to a bowl with the cooked rice, mushroom and beef. Season with salt and pepper and use your hands to mix together very well, squeezing the filling through your fingers.

Divide the filling into eight equal portions and form each into a fat cylinder. Place a cylinder at the bottom of each cabbage leaf, roll it up halfway, then fold in the sides and continue wrapping to make a neat roll. Place all the rolls in a roasting tin or baking dish so they fit snugly. Pour over the tomato sauce, cover the rolls with the extra cabbage leaves, and cook in the oven for about 1 hour, or until the filling inside them feels firm to the touch. Check the rolls after 50 minutes - you may need to place a sheet of foil over the rolls to prevent them from burning during cooking. Serve the rolls with the sauce.`

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often and scraping the base of the pan to make sure it doesn't catch, until the chicken is cooked through and lightly browned. Remove the chicken to a bowl.

Return the pan to the heat and when any bits stuck to the base of the pan are sizzling, add the stock and use a wooden spoon to loosen them. When it is all thoroughly detached, pour the stock over the chicken.

Heat the remaining oil in a clean pan over medium heat. Add the onion and mushroom, and sprinkle in the remaining salt - this helps the vegetables to break down. Stir constantly over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Return the chicken and stock to the pan with the sour cream, stirring well to incorporate.

      "240 ml (8 fl oz) lukewarm full-cream milk",
      "30 g (1 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "9 g (3/8 oz) instant dried yeast",
      "400 g (14 oz) plain (all-purpose) flour, plus extra for dusting",

      "40 g (1 1/2 oz) icing (confectioners') sugar",
      "2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste"
    ],
    method: `Combine 100 ml (3 1/2 fl oz) of the milk with the sugar and yeast in a bowl. Set aside for 5-7 minutes or until the yeast is foaming.

Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add the yeast mixture and the remaining milk and mix on low speed to form a shaggy dough. Add the egg and butter, increase the speed to medium and knead for 5-7 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic and pulls away from the side of the bowl.

Cover the bowl of your mixer with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for 1-1 1/2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size (see page 334 for my favourite proving options).

Generously spray a 27 cm (10 3/4 inch) bundt tin with oil or brush it with melted butter.

Once the dough has doubled, knock it back by pressing down on the dough to knock out the air that's trapped inside. Turn the dough out onto your lightly floured bench. Cut it into 20 g (3/4 oz) pieces and roll it into rough balls (they don't need to be exactly the same weight, just try to get them as close as possible).

For the cinnamon coating, combine the two sugars and cinnamon in a bowl. Dip one of the dough balls into the melted butter before rolling it in the cinnamon sugar. Place the ball in the bundt tin and repeat with the remaining dough balls, completely filling the tin. Combine the remaining melted butter with the left-over cinnamon sugar and pour it over the dough balls in the tin.

Put the tin in a warm place for 45 minutes or until the dough is puffy and doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 160C (320F).

Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes or until golden (cover the tin with foil if it's browning too quickly). Allow the monkey bread to cool in the tin for 15 minutes before turning it out onto a plate.

For the glaze, whisk the sour cream, icing sugar and vanilla together, adding 3-4 tablespoons water so it reaches a drizzling consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the monkey bread. This is best eaten fresh, so dig in while it's still slightly warm and oozy.`

      "25 ml (3/4 fl oz) full-cream milk",
      "2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste",
      "1/4 teaspoon almond extract"
    ],
    method: `Knock back the risen bread dough. Turn the dough out onto your lightly floured bench and roll it into a large rectangle, approximately 30 x 40 cm (12 x 16 inches). I try to roll it out really evenly for the best end result.

Spread the creme patissiere over the dough and scatter the diced apple over the top. Roll it up into a tight log, then cut the log into 2.5 cm (1 inch) scrolls.

Line a baking tray with baking paper or a silicone baking mat and arrange the scrolls on the tray so that they are 2 cm (3/4 inch) apart. Set aside in a warm place for 45-60 minutes or until the scrolls have doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 170C (340F).

Bake the scrolls for 35-40 minutes or until they are golden brown. Allow to cool to room temperature.

For the icing, combine all of the ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until the icing is smooth, being sure to scrape down the side of the bowl to ensure there are no lumps of butter remaining.

Top the cooled scrolls with the icing and the toasted almond flakes.

Mix it up! Replace the apples in the filling with one of the following options: 2 cubed pears; 2 cubed mangoes; 200 g (7 oz) fresh berries, quartered (frozen berries will release too much liquid); 400 g (14 oz) tin black cherries in syrup, drained and patted dry.`

      "130 ml (4 fl oz) full-cream milk"

    method: `For the tangzhong, combine the flour and milk in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat until a thick paste forms. Don't worry about lumps - it will be kneaded into the bread anyway.

In an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the tangzhong, milk, sugar and yeast and mix briefly on medium-low speed to cool down the tangzhong. Next, add the salt, egg and flour and increase the speed of your mixer to medium to begin kneading. This is a really wet dough so it will need to be kneaded for a good 10-15 minutes. Don't be tempted to add any extra flour - as the dough is kneaded, it will eventually gather together.

Once the dough comes away from the side of the bowl, add the butter and mix until incorporated. It will look like the dough isn't going to absorb the butter, but just keep kneading with the mixer until it does.

Turn the dough out onto your lightly floured bench, flour your hands and bring the dough together into a ball.

Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap to create a nice humid environment. Leave the dough in a warm place to rise for 1-1 1/2 hours or until it has doubled in size (see page 334 for my favourite proving options).

Once the dough has doubled, knock it back (the best bit) by pressing down on the dough to knock out all of that beautiful air trapped inside. Turn the dough out onto a very lightly floured bench and gently push out the excess air. At this point, the dough is ready to shape into whatever yeasty bake you are making.`

      "Fresh berries, mango and passionfruit, to serve"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 180C (350F). Line a 23 cm (9 inch) round cake tin with baking paper.

Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites and salt until foaming. Slowly add the caster sugar and whisk until a thick meringue has formed.

Combine the almond meal, icing sugar and flour in a separate bowl and whisk well. Add the coconut and mix well. Fold the mixture through the meringue, being careful not to knock the air out of the mixture.

Spread the batter in the cake tin and bake for 35-45 minutes or until the dacquoise is lightly golden brown. Allow to cool completely in the tin.

For the syrup, combine the sugar, lemon rind and 390 ml (13 1/4 fl oz) water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil over medium heat, without stirring, and cook until the sugar has dissolved. Turn off the heat and allow the syrup to cool while you get on with the cake.

Discard the lemon rind from the cooled syrup and evenly pour the syrup over the hot cake. (Syruping rule of thumb: hot cake/cold syrup or cold cake/hot syrup. This ensures that the syrup absorbs well and doesn't pool on the top of the cake, which is what usually happens if both the cake and syrup are cold.) Set the cake aside for 1-2 hours to allow the syrup to penetrate.

For the buttercream, combine the sugar and egg whites in the heatproof bowl of your electric mixer. Sit the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (don't let the water touch the bowl) and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar has completely dissolved or the temperature reaches 70C (158F) on a sugar thermometer.

Use the whisk attachment of the mixer to whisk the mixture until a thick meringue forms and the bowl is cool to touch. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the butter and coconut extract. Mix for a good 7-10 minutes or until the buttercream is smooth and silky. (If the buttercream appears split, it's usually because the butter is too cold. It will come together with more mixing, so just keep going!)

Refer to the instructions on pages 100-103 to layer and assemble the cake. Once the cake has been iced with the buttercream, completely cover it with the shredded coconut.

To serve, pile the dacquoise high with the chantilly cream, berries, mango and passionfruit.`

    author: "Emelia Jackson",
    book: "First Cream the Butter & The Sugar",
    category: "Dessert",
    serves: "Makes a 23 cm (9 inch) cake",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "30 Oreo cookies, crushed with their filling",
      "50 g (1 3/4 oz) unsalted butter, melted",
      "1 tablespoon dark cocoa powder",
      "750 g (1 lb 10 oz) cream cheese, softened",
      "200 g (7 oz) golden caster (superfine) sugar",
      "50 g (1 3/4 oz) dark cocoa powder",
      "50 ml (1 3/4 fl oz) whisky",
      "1 1/4 tablespoons vanilla bean paste or extract",
      "Grated zest of 1 orange",
      "300 g (10 1/2 oz) good-quality dark chocolate, melted",
      "4 eggs, at room temperature",
      "2 egg yolks, at room temperature",
      "200 ml (7 fl oz) thickened (whipping) cream",
      "100 g (3 1/2 oz) good-quality dark chocolate, chopped",
      "25 ml (3/4 fl oz) whisky",
      "20 g (3/4 oz) unsalted butter"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 150C (300F). Wrap the outside of a 23 cm (9 inch) spring-form cake tin in foil to ensure no water enters while the cheesecake is baking in the water bath.

For the crust, place the crushed Oreos in a food processor and process to fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and cocoa and process in short bursts until combined. Spoon the crumb mixture into the cake tin and lightly press the mixture into the base (I use the bottom of a glass or mug). Place in the fridge for 30 minutes to set.

For the filling, put the cream cheese, sugar, cocoa, whisky, vanilla and orange zest in the food processor and blend until completely smooth, stopping and scraping down the side of the bowl a few times to remove any lumps. Once smooth, add the melted chocolate, eggs, egg yolks and cream and process until just combined and the mixture is smooth and glossy.

Pour the filling over the chilled crust. Place the tin in a roasting tin and pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up the side of the cake tin. Bake the cheesecake for 1 1/2 hours - you still want a slight jiggle in the centre to ensure a luscious texture (the cheesecake will set completely as it cools in the fridge).

Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and run a sharp knife around the edge of the tin to loosen the side - this will help prevent it from cracking as it cools and shrinks. Set aside to cool completely in the tin, then transfer to the fridge to set (overnight is best).

Remove the cheesecake from the tin and place it on a serving plate. For the ganache drip, combine the cream, chocolate, whisky and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on medium for 2-3 minutes or until completely melted. Whisk to emulsify and allow to cool slightly.

Pour the ganache all over the top of the cheesecake - it will set as it hits the cold cheesecake, so it's ready to eat straight away.`

    author: "Emelia Jackson",
    book: "First Cream the Butter & The Sugar",
    category: "Baking",
    serves: "Makes 10",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "1 batch Sweet bread dough (page 336)",
      "2 egg yolks",
      "2 tablespoons milk",
      "Vanilla chantilly cream (page 385)",
      "Icing (confectioners') sugar, for dusting"
    ],
    method: `Knock back the risen bread dough. Turn the dough out onto your lightly floured bench and divide it into 10 even pieces. To shape the dough into perfect balls, cup your hand around a dough ball and move it in a circular motion until it forms a smooth ball.

Line a baking tray with baking paper or a silicone baking mat and place the balls on the tray, leaving 5 cm (2 inches) between them to allow for rising (you don't want them to be touching each other when baking). Set aside in a warm place for 30 minutes or until puffy and doubled in size. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180C (350F).

Whisk the egg yolks with the milk, then brush it over the puffy buns. Bake the buns for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool completely.

Slice each bun across the top without cutting through to the base. Fill the slits with the chantilly cream and use a spatula to smooth off the excess. Serve the buns dusted with icing sugar.`

    serves: "Makes 16",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "100 g (3 1/2 oz) unsalted butter",
      "50 g (1 3/4 oz) dark chocolate (70%), chopped",
      "6 eggs",
      "145 g (5 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "50 g (1 3/4 oz) cornflour (cornstarch)",
      "120 g (4 1/4 oz) almond meal",
      "30 g (1 oz) dark cocoa powder",
      "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
      "1 large gelatine leaf (see page 16)",
      "600 ml (21 fl oz) thickened (whipping) cream",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste",
      "200 g (7 oz) dark chocolate (minimum 54%), chopped",
      "680 g (1 lb 8 oz) morello cherries in syrup",
      "150 g (5 1/4 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "1 vanilla bean"
    ],
    method: `For the whipped ganache, add the gelatine to a small bowl of iced water and set aside for 5 minutes to bloom. Once softened, squeeze out any excess water and set aside.

Meanwhile, combine the cream, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat, add the gelatine and stir until completely melted. Put the chocolate in a bowl and pour in the hot cream. Once the chocolate has melted, whisk until well combined. Place in the fridge overnight or until completely chilled.

Preheat the oven to 160C (320F). Melt the butter and chocolate together, either in the microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat.

Whisk the eggs and sugar in a large bowl until just combined, then add the cornflour, almond meal, cocoa, baking powder and chocolate mixture and whisk until thoroughly combined.

Spoon the batter into a silicone mini muffin tray, filling each of the moulds three-quarters full. Bake the cupcakes for 15-20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before turning the cakes out to cool completely.

To make the jam, pour the cherries and syrup into a saucepan and sprinkle the sugar over the top. Split the vanilla bean lengthways, scrape the seeds into the pan, add the empty pod and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, for 45 minutes or until the jam is sticky and reduced.

Remove the vanilla bean. Pour the jam into a jar or container and allow it to cool completely. (It can be stored in the fridge for a couple of weeks and is great on top of Greek-style yoghurt.)

Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the chilled ganache until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhisk it because the ganache can split (especially if you use chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa solids). If the ganache does split, you will need to melt it again and let it chill before whisking.

Transfer the whipped ganache to a piping bag fitted with a round nozzle. Pipe a decent mound onto each cake and use a warm spoon to create an indent in the top. Fill the indent with cherry jam.`

    title: "Coconut syrup cake",
    author: "Emelia Jackson",
    book: "First Cream the Butter & The Sugar",
    category: "Dessert",
    serves: "Makes a 20 cm (8 inch) two-layer cake",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "5 eggs",
      "180 g (6 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste",
      "1/2 teaspoon coconut extract",
      "150 ml (6 fl oz) full-cream milk",
      "150 ml (6 fl oz) neutral-flavoured oil, such as grapeseed oil",
      "350 g (12 oz) self-raising flour",
      "1 teaspoon baking powder",
      "125 g (4 1/2 oz) desiccated coconut",
      "390 g (13 3/4 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "1 lemon, cut into strips",
      "400 g (14 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "200 g (7 oz) egg whites",
      "350 g (12 oz) unsalted butter, softened",
      "3/4 teaspoon coconut extract",
      "150 g (5 1/2 oz) shredded coconut, to decorate"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 170C (340F). Line two 20 cm (8 inch) cake tins with baking paper.

For the syrup, combine the sugar, lemon rind and 390 ml (13 1/4 fl oz) water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil over medium heat, without stirring, and cook until the sugar has dissolved. Turn off the heat and allow the syrup to cool while you get on with the cake.

Using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs, sugar, vanilla and coconut extract until doubled in volume and light in colour. Pour in the milk and oil and mix until just combined.

Sift the flour and baking powder over the egg mixture and gently fold together until just combined. Finally, fold in the desiccated coconut.

Split the batter between the cake tins and bake for 55-65 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Use the skewer to poke holes in the hot cakes, right through to the base of the tin.

Discard the lemon rind from the cooled syrup and evenly pour the syrup over the hot cake. (Syruping rule of thumb: hot cake/cold syrup or cold cake/hot syrup. This ensures that the syrup absorbs well and doesn't pool on the top of the cake, which is what usually happens if both the cake and syrup are cold.) Set the cake aside for 1-2 hours to allow the syrup to penetrate.

For the buttercream, combine the sugar and egg whites in the heatproof bowl of your electric mixer. Sit the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (don't let the water touch the bowl) and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar has completely dissolved or the temperature reaches 70C (158F) on a sugar thermometer.

Use the whisk attachment of the mixer to whisk the mixture until a thick meringue forms and the bowl is cool to touch. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the butter and coconut extract. Mix for a good 7-10 minutes or until the buttercream is smooth and silky. (If the buttercream appears split, it's usually because the butter is too cold. It will come together with more mixing, so just keep going!)

Refer to the instructions on pages 100-103 to layer and assemble the cake. Once the cake has been iced with the buttercream, completely cover it with the shredded coconut.`

Beat in the eggs, then stir in the flours and half of the sea salt flakes.

Pour the batter into the cake tin and smooth the top. Pat the morello cherries with paper towel to remove any excess moisture. Stud the brownie batter with the cherries and sprinkle with the remaining sea salt flakes.

Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the brownie is golden brown at the edges but still fudgy in the centre. Leave to cool in the tin, then transfer the brownie to the fridge to chill overnight (or for at least 4 hours).

Remove the chilled brownie from the tin and trim the edges. Use a wet knife to cut the brownie into 16 squares (or whatever size you wish). Serve at room temperature.`

Peel and cut the apples into 2 cm (3/4 inch) dice and put them in a heatproof bowl along with the dates and bicarbonate of soda. Pour in the boiling water. (The bicarbonate of soda may fizz up, so use a bowl large enough to accommodate this.) Give it all a stir and allow it to sit while you get on with the rest of the cake.

Put the caster sugar, oil, eggs, vanilla and salt in a large bowl and whisk until just combined. Lightly fold in the flour and baking powder. Tip in the apple mixture (including the liquid) and gently mix until just incorporated.

Pour the batter into the tin and bake the cake for 60-65 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

Meanwhile, for the topping, combine the brown sugar, cream, butter, honey and vanilla in a saucepan. Stir over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to the boil. Once the sugar has melted and the caramel is boiling, stir in the coconut.

Gently pour the topping over the cake and spread it in an even layer. Return the cake to the oven and bake for a further 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 20 minutes (this will help the caramel set), then remove it from the tin and allow it to cool completely.`

    method: `Preheat the oven to 160C (320F). Line two 18 cm (7 inch) round cake tins with baking paper.

Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the sugar, butter and lemon zest or lemon extract until light, creamy and fluffy. Add the vanilla, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt and mix until thoroughly combined. (I like to add the raising agents at this point to ensure they are evenly dispersed throughout the cake batter, creating an even rise in the final cake.) Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined.

Whisk the sour cream and milk in a small jug or bowl.

Sift the flour over the egg mixture, then gently fold together until just combined. Lightly mix in the sour cream mixture until the batter just comes together.

To prevent all of the blueberries from sinking to the bottom of your cake, first divide a quarter of the batter between the cake tins and smooth the top. Mix the blueberries through the remaining batter and divide it between the tins.

Bake the cakes for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of each cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

For the icing, whisk the mascarpone, cream, icing sugar and vanilla in a bowl until thickened. Be careful not to overwhisk the cream as it can easily split.

Use a serrated knife to level the tops of the cakes, if needed. Put one of the cakes on a serving plate and spread it with about a third of the icing. Add the second cake and spread the remaining icing all over the top and side. Garnish the cake with the fresh blueberries and lemon zest.`

    method: `Combine the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Give these dry ingredients a good whisk and set aside.

Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla. Reserve some of the chocolate chips to add to the cookies after baking. Add all of the dry ingredients and the remaining chocolate chips to the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Do not overmix the dough once the flour has been added.

Refrigerate the cookie dough for 12-36 hours before baking. The longer you refrigerate the dough, the more flavour development will occur, the less the cookies will spread and the better the overall texture will be.

When you're ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 180C (350F). Line two baking trays with baking paper or silicone baking mats and place six golf ball-sized rounds of dough on the trays, using about 50 g (1 3/4 oz) dough for each one. The cookies will spread, so give them space to do their thing. Sprinkle with extra sea salt flakes.

Bake the cookies in batches for 12-14 minutes or until caramelised around the edges but still soft and blond towards the centre. As soon as the cookies are out of the oven, sprinkle with the remaining chocolate chips. Allow to cool on the trays for 15 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack.`

      "100 g (3 1/2 oz) egg yolks",
      "100 g (3 1/2 oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "1 tablespoon instant coffee powder",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste",
      "250 g (9 oz) unsalted butter, softened"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 160C (320F). Line a baking tray with baking paper or silicone baking mats. Line two 18 cm (7 inch) round cake tins with baking paper.

To make the streusel topping, combine the butter, flour and demerara sugar in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips to form coarse crumbs. Add the walnuts, cinnamon and salt and toss to combine. Spread the mixture over the baking tray and bake for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown. Set aside to cool.

Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugars until pale and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix until completely incorporated. The mixture may look slightly curdled, but it will come back together once the dry ingredients are added.

Add the baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and coffee mixture and mix to combine. Stir in the flour, milk and walnuts until just combined, being sure to scrape down the side of the bowl.

Split the batter between the cake tins and bake for 35-40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before removing the cakes from the tins to cool completely.

For the French coffee buttercream, combine the egg yolks, sugar, coffee powder and vanilla in a heatproof electric mixer bowl. Sit the bowl over a saucepan half-filled with boiling water and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer the bowl to the electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whisk until the egg yolk mixture is aerated and thickened, around 6-8 minutes. Once the mixture has cooled, add the butter and whisk until light and creamy.

Place one of the cakes on a serving plate. Pipe rosettes of buttercream around the outside edge of the cake, then fill the hollow with more buttercream and liberally sprinkle with the streusel topping. Add the second cake, pipe more rosettes of buttercream on top and then garnish with the remaining streusel.`

      "75 ml (2 1/2 fl oz) thickened (whipping) cream",
      "40 g (1 1/2 oz) cold butter, diced"
    ],
    method: `To make the peanut dacquoise, preheat the oven to 170C (340F) and line a 30 x 15 cm (12 x 6 in) baking tray with baking paper.

In a bowl, mix together the peanuts, icing sugar and ground almonds.

Whisk the egg whites in an electric mixer until they form soft peaks. While still whisking, gradually sprinkle in the caster sugar and whisk until stiff and glossy. When the whites are ready, transfer them to a large bowl and gently fold the nut mixture through the meringue until combined.

Spread the mixture out on the lined baking tray to a thickness of about 3 mm (1/4 in). Bake for 8 minutes and then turn the tray 180 degrees and return it to the oven for another 8 minutes or until lightly golden. Leave to cool to room temperature.

Line a 30 x 15 x 5 cm (12 x 6 x 2 in) plastic tray with baking paper.

Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and scatter 140 g (5 oz) of the sugar over the base. Heat until the sugar melts and starts to colour. Continue to cook, swirling the sugar in the pan occasionally, until you have a light golden caramel, about 2-3 minutes.

Remove the pan from the heat and add 300 ml (10 fl oz) of the cream, half the glucose and the vanilla bean paste. Return to the heat and bring to a simmer, whisking to dissolve any lumps. Add the peanut butter, then the butter and whisk to combine.

Squeeze out any excess water from the softened gelatine leaves, then whisk the gelatine into the hot liquid. Remove the mixture from the heat and strain through a fine sieve into a large bowl.

Put the egg yolks in a stand mixer and whisk until pale and tripled in volume, about 2-3 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring the remaining sugar, glucose and 1 1/2 tablespoons water to the boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Cook until the temperature reaches 117C (243F).

With the mixer running on medium speed, pour the hot sugar syrup into the egg yolks in a steady stream. Continue to whisk the eggs for 3 minutes.

Fold the yolk mixture into the peanut butter mixture and cool to room temperature.

Finally, fold the whipped cream into the peanut mixture and pour it into your prepared tray or individual silicone moulds. Carefully place the dacquoise on top of your parfait, making sure the smooth bottom of the dacquoise is facing up, cover with plastic wrap and freeze overnight. If using individual moulds, cut rings of the meringue the same size as your silicone moulds.

To make the chocolate ganache, in a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and powdered glucose.

In a small saucepan, bring the milk and 100 ml (3 1/2 fl oz) of the cream to the boil. Allow this to cool slightly for 5 minutes then pour it into the egg mixture, whisking as you pour, until thoroughly combined. Return the custard to the saucepan and stir over low heat until it starts to thicken, about 4-6 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.

Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Do not let the water touch the base of the bowl and do not let the temperature of the chocolate rise above 50C (122F). Turn off the heat under the saucepan and mix the custard into the melted chocolate a third at a time.

Whisk the remaining cream to soft peaks and fold it into the chocolate mixture. Transfer to a container with a lid and store in the refrigerator.

To make the butterscotch sauce, heat a saucepan over medium-high heat, scatter the caster sugar over the base and cook until it turns a light golden colour, swirling the pan occasionally to cook evenly. Once the sugar has evenly caramelised to a dark golden colour, reduce the heat and add 50 ml (1 3/4 fl oz) water to the caramel. Next, whisk in the brown sugar and cream together. Once the brown sugar has dissolved, add the butter and whisk until incorporated. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve and set aside to cool to room temperature. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.

To serve, remove the parfait from the freezer and turn it out onto a chopping board. Leave it to thaw slightly until it is a workable consistency. When soft enough, cut it into 10 even-sized pieces.

Place a portion of parfait on each serving plate. Spoon a tablespoon of butterscotch sauce over each parfait. Top with some crushed peanuts and 1 tablespoon chocolate ganache.`

    method: `To make the pressed pig's head, combine the five-spice and salt and sprinkle this mixture over the pig's head. Place on a rack in a baking dish and leave overnight in the refrigerator.

Place a saucepan fitted with a steamer on the stove and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Place the pig's head in the steamer and cook for 3 hours. Remove from the steamer and, when the head is cool enough to handle, remove as much of the meat, skin and fat as possible, apart from the eyes. The head should yield approximately 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) meat.

Thinly slice the ear. Peel the tongue and roughly chop it along with the rest of the flesh.

In a large bowl, mix the meat well with the remaining ingredients. Taste to check the seasoning.

Line a 20 x 10 cm (8 x 4 in) deep tray with plastic wrap. Press the prepared head meat into the tray. Cover with plastic wrap and cover with another tray the same size. Chill in the refrigerator until very firm. Once set, cut the meat into 2.5 cm (1 in) squares.

To make the chilli tamarind dressing, heat a chargrill pan until hot. Place the fresh chillies on the grill, turning them until nicely charred. Next grill the dried chillies. Seed the fresh chillies and roughly chop them with the dried chillies. Set aside.

In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, gently warm the grapeseed oil. Add the shallots and garlic and cook for 3-4 minutes until aromatic and wilted. Add the chilli and cook until aromatic. Transfer the shallots and chillies to a blender along with the coriander, scud chillies, tamarind, sugar, fish sauce, 2 tablespoons water and the lime juice. Blend the sauce until completely smooth. Set aside.

Put the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in three separate shallow bowls. Dip the pork squares first in the flour, then in the beaten egg and finally in the breadcrumbs, pressing to adhere.

Prepare the buns, place them in a bamboo steamer basket lined with baking paper and set aside.

Heat the grapeseed oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Fry the crumbed pork until golden on all sides.

Bring some water in a saucepan large enough to fit the bamboo steamer to the boil. While the pork is cooking, steam the buns for 4-5 minutes or until soft in the centre.

To finish, open the buns and place 1/2 teaspoon of tamarind dressing onto each one, followed by a piece of fried pork, 2 slices of cucumber, 1/2 teaspoon more of tamarind dressing and some coriander.`

Combine the salted cabbage with the egg yolk, spring onion, garlic chives, garlic, ginger, pork, soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, sugar, potato starch, stock and five-spice in a bowl and mix well. It's easiest to work the ingredients into the pork by hand.

To form the dumplings, place 1 1/2-2 teaspoons of the filling in the centre of a gyoza wrapper. Lightly wet one edge of the wrapper, fold the dough over and firmly pinch the edges together. Lay the dumplings on a floured tray until ready to cook.

Combine the flour with 200 ml (7 fl oz) water, whisking well.

Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan with a fitted lid over medium heat. Place 6 dumplings in the pan. Fry for 1 minute then add 60 ml (2 fl oz/1/4 cup) of the flour and water mixture to the pan. Put the lid on and steam for 3 minutes. Remove the lid and cook for a further 5-8 minutes until the dumplings are cooked through and their bottoms are golden. Carefully loosen the dumplings and crust and flip them onto a plate.

Serve with small bowls of Chinese black vinegar for dipping.`

    ],
    method: `This is not a traditional ramen whatsoever. We have taken the basic principles of ramen and created our own version, which we serve at lunchtime. Traditionally, ramen stock is made from pork and can be quite rich. I prefer a lighter-style broth, which is the reason I use a chicken stock here.

To make the soy eggs, in a small saucepan bring all the ingredients, except the eggs, to a simmer. Cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Add 500 ml (17 fl oz/2 cups) cold water, remove the pan from the heat and set aside.

Bring a saucepan of water to the boil. Pierce a small hole in the larger end of each egg using a thin metal skewer.

Carefully put the eggs in the boiling water and cook for exactly 6 minutes, stirring slowly for the first 1 1/2 minutes to distribute the heat evenly.

Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with cold water and ice. When the eggs are done, transfer them straight to the ice bath and leave to cool for 15 minutes.

Once the eggs are cool, peel them in the water. Transfer the eggs to the soy sauce mixture and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 and up to 6 hours, making sure they're completely submerged in the liquid by placing a small plate on top of them.

To serve, take the eggs out of the marinade and cut them in half lengthways. The soy sauce mixture can be reserved for another batch of eggs.

To make the ramen broth, preheat the oven to 220C (430F).

Chop the chicken wings into 3 cm (1 1/4 in) pieces with a cleaver. Put them in an ovenproof dish and roast for 30 minutes or until golden brown.

Heat a chargrill pan over high heat. Cook the carrot and onion for 10 minutes on one side until well charred.

Put all the broth ingredients, except the soy sauce, in a large stainless steel stockpot and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 2 hours to develop the flavours. Strain the stock through a fine sieve and add the soy sauce.

In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the strained ramen broth to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low.

Heat the grapeseed oil in a non-stick frying pan over low heat. Place the chicken thighs, skin side down, in the pan and cook gently for 5 minutes, or until golden. Turn the chicken over and cook for a further 2 minutes, or until cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and slice each thigh into 8 pieces.

Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Carefully drop in the dumplings, if using, and cook for 2 minutes. Drop the noodles into the same pot and cook with the dumplings for a further 3 minutes. Strain through a colander.

Divide the noodles and dumplings between four bowls. Place 1 egg and 4 slices of chicken in each bowl, then divide the hot broth among the bowls. Top with the spring onion greens and sprinkle with a combination of shichimi togarashi and ground sesame seeds. Finally, tuck 3 squares of toasted nori into the side of the bowl and serve.`

      "30 g (1 oz/1/2 cup) thinly sliced spring onion (scallion)",
      "125 ml (4 fl oz/1/2 cup) chilli crisp sauce"
    ],
    method: `In a bowl, combine the prawns with the egg white, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, the tapioca and bicarbonate of soda and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 1 hour.

To make the spiced vinegar, toast the spices in a small, dry frying pan over medium heat until fragrant. Add 200 ml (7 fl oz) water and bring to the boil. Boil until reduced by half. Set aside to cool. When cool, strain and discard the spices. Stir in the remaining ingredients and set aside.

Heat the grapeseed oil in a small saucepan over medium heat and cook the garlic chives for 1 minute then scrape them into a bowl to cool.

Take the prawns from the refrigerator and coarsely dice one-third of them. Finely chop the remainder of the prawns into a mince. Mix the prawn and chicken mince together and combine them by repeatedly throwing the mixture against the inside of the mixing bowl. It will become a sticky, cohesive mass. Finally add the garlic chives, sesame oil, sugar, remaining salt, the fish sauce, soy sauce and white pepper. Thoroughly mix these ingredients through the mince.

To make the dumplings, place a rounded teaspoon of the filling in the centre of a wonton wrapper. Dip your finger in water and moisten the bottom edge of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half towards you, to enclose the filling. Press to seal.

Fold the sealed edge of the wonton back on itself then lightly moisten one corner of the folded edge with water. Finally, taking the 2 ends in your fingers, bring them together with a twisting action, and press them firmly to join. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.

Cook the dumplings in batches for 4 minutes in a large saucepan of boiling water. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain. Serve immediately with some spiced vinegar spooned over the top.`

      "60 ml (2 fl oz/1/4 cup) grapeseed oil",
      "3 teaspoons sesame oil"
    ],
    method: `Intercostal meat, also known as rib finger, is the meat found between ribs. It's not always readily available so it's a good idea to order it in advance from your butcher.

Trim the beef intercostals of any excess fat and sinew then place the meat in a baking dish just large enough to hold it in a single layer. Mix the sweet soy sauce through the beef and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 150C (300F).

Fill the baking dish with the beef in it with just enough water to cover the meat. Cover the dish with foil and cook the beef in the oven for 3-4 hours until the meat is tender but not falling apart. Keep an eye on the water level and top up as necessary. When the meat is tender, allow it to cool in its liquid in the refrigerator.

To make the Korean chilli dressing, in a small bowl, mix all the ingredients together. Leave the sauce at room temperature for an hour before using, to let the flavour develop.

When you're ready to finish the dish, preheat a barbecue or chargrill pan to high.

Drain the beef and discard the liquid. Cut the beef into pieces roughly 6 cm (2 1/2 in) long. When the grill is hot, brush the meat with a little grapeseed oil and cook the meat on the grill for 3 minutes on each side, or until the beef is charred and hot.

Remove the beef from the heat and season with salt. Arrange on a plate with the Korean dressing and a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds or fried shallots.`

      "110 g (4 oz/1/2 cup) sugar",

    ],
    method: `We've tested many types of Korean rice cakes at Supernormal. The Chongga brand is the best we've found to date. They have great texture, crisp up nicely in the pan and don't seem to soak up much oil at all.

To make the Korean sweet chilli sauce, combine all the ingredients with 60 ml (2 fl oz/1/4 cup) water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook gently for 5 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by half and slightly thickened. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for 30 minutes.

Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and drop in the rice cakes. Boil for 3 minutes or until soft. Drain them and pat dry with paper towel.

In a non-stick frying pan over high heat, heat half the grapeseed oil until hot. Carefully add half the blanched rice cakes and reduce the heat to medium. Saute the rice cakes until crunchy, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the cakes and cook the remaining rice cakes in the same manner.

When all the rice cakes are crunchy, place them in a bowl with the Korean sweet chilli sauce. Toss well with the sauce and serve immediately topped with the ground sesame seeds.`

Lay the fillets on the tray, skin side down, then sprinkle the flesh with salt. Bake for approximately 6 minutes. The fish will be ready when the flesh flakes easily when pressed. (If you're nervous about undercooked fish you can leave it a little longer as this recipe can handle it.) Set aside to cool. When cool, pull the flesh away from the skin and shred into a bowl. Add the taratoor and toum and mix well.

Arrange on a plate or in a bowl, then drizzle with the olive oil. Sprinkle with the chilli and sumac.

If using the flaked almonds, you could simply sprinkle them on top or get pretty corny and stick them into the brandade to look like fish scales. You could even use pine nuts for eyes.`

    method: `Heat a small frying pan over a low heat and add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and the pine nuts. Fry gently until the pine nuts start to change colour and become golden. At this point, strain through a small sieve and spread them on a plate or tray lined with paper towel. They will continue to colour so be sure to take them off the heat before they get too brown.

Heat the remaining oil in a small saucepan over a high heat until very hot, then add the onion, stirring frequently until it starts to colour. Turn down the heat to low and allow the onion to caramelise slowly. Cook for approximately 30 minutes until completely soft and dark brown. Season with salt and allspice, then add the currants, stirring through the onion until well combined. Remove from the heat.

For the cauliflower, fill a saucepan with heavily salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cut the cauliflower into florets at least the size of a golf ball and no bigger than a mandarin. Boil in the salted water for 8-10 minutes until soft, then remove from the water with a kitchen spider or strain through a sieve. Spread on a tray lined with paper towel or a tea towel and allow to cool and dry out a little.

When ready to fry, heat the oil in a saucepan or deep-fryer to 180C (350F). Dredge the cauliflower in the flour then shake off any excess in a sieve. Fry until dark brown. Yes - dark!

Remove from the oil and drain on some paper towel. Season with salt and pepper, then arrange on a plate and top with the caramelised onion, currants and pine nuts.`

      "1/3 cup plus 1/4 cup malted milk powder",
      "2 tablespoons granulated sugar"
    ],
    method: `Make the miso-toffee sauce: In a medium saucepan or skillet, combine 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar, 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, and 2 tablespoons miso paste. Place over high heat and whisk to combine. When the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat as needed to maintain a lively boil and cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture has darkened a few shades and thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and chill in the refrigerator until cold.

Make the Grape-Nut crumbles: In a medium skillet, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons unsalted butter over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, add 1 1/2 cups Grape-Nuts and cook, stirring often, until sizzling and a shade darker, about 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup malted milk powder, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, for 1 minute to marry the flavors. Let cool.

Whip the cream: Pour the remaining 2 cups heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat the cream until lofty but not quite holding peaks. Add the remaining 1/3 cup malted milk powder, 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar, and a large pinch of salt. Continue to beat until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat. Beat in 1/2 cup sour cream just until incorporated.

Scoop out about 1/2 cup of the whipped cream and fold it into the chilled coffee toffee sauce, gently stirring and folding with a spatula to incorporate. This will lighten the sauce a bit.

Assemble: Thinly slice 5 large ripe bananas on a bias. Choose your assembly vessel: either 8 glass cups or ramekins or one larger glass baking dish or bowl. Layer the elements in the following order, making 2 layers: Grape-Nuts crumbles, toffee sauce, bananas, whipped cream, repeat. End with a big dollop of whipped cream, spreading it to cover the bananas. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day before serving.

Serve by the big scoopful if you made one large one, or individually if not.`

      "1 large egg",
      "3/4 cup (90g) raw, shelled pistachios",
      "4 ounces (112g) dark chocolate (not chips)",

      "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
      "1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour",
      "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
      "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
      "3 ounces (85g) halva (preferably pistachio-flavored)",
      "Flaky sea salt"
    ],
    method: `Pulse the pistachios: Place 3/4 cup raw shelled pistachios in the bowl of a food processor and pulse several times until chopped but not yet finely ground. Scoop out and set aside 2 to 3 tablespoons of the chopped nuts for the cookie tops. Continue pulsing the pistachios in long pulses until very finely ground, about 1 minute.

Brown the butter: Cut 10 tablespoons butter into 1-inch pieces. Place in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring the pot every minute or so, until the butter has turned very foamy and bubbling but not yet browned, about 6 minutes. Quickly add the finely ground pistachios and cook, stirring constantly, until they smell very nutty and are golden brown and the butter has browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. The nuts should no longer be bright green and the butter around them should be deeply speckled with brown. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the brown butter mixture into a large bowl. Add 1 ice cube to the butter and let the ice cube melt and the butter cool for 10 minutes.

Make the cookie dough: Chop 4 ounces dark chocolate into irregular 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch chunks. To the cooled butter, add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 large egg, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract. Whisk vigorously until well combined and thickened, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and stir well with a spatula or wooden spoon until combined and a sticky dough forms. Add half of the chopped chocolate along with 2 ounces halva, crumbling it lightly with your fingers as you add it. Gently stir to combine. Cover the top of the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and ideally overnight.

Scoop, top, and bake: Preheat the oven to 375F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a 2-ounce ice cream scoop or large spoon, scoop out 12 equal portions of dough, rolling them into a rough ball shape. Working one at a time, dip the tops of the dough balls into the reserved chopped pistachios, then place them on the baking sheets about 2 1/2 inches apart. Dot the tops of each cookie with a few more big shards of the reserved chocolate chunks and another crumble or two of halva, pressing lightly with your fingers to encourage the chunks and crumbles to adhere. Bake, rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and front to back after about 8 minutes, until the cookies are browned at the edges and no longer wet on top, 12 to 14 minutes total.

While still warm, sprinkle the cookies with flaky sea salt. Once cool enough to handle, transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. Store the cookies in an airtight container to make them last longer.`

      "1/3 cup all-purpose flour",
      "3 tablespoons Dijon mustard",
      "3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce",
      "1 cup panko bread crumbs"
    ],
    method: `Do some prep: Position a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400F. Butter a 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Lightly smash and peel 10 garlic cloves, then thinly slice them. Grate 1 1/2 pounds mixed cheeses on the large holes of a box grater. Strip the leaves of 14 ounces leafy greens from the stems and tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. When the water boils, stir in 12 ounces curly pasta and cook just short of al dente, 2 minutes shy of the package directions. Drain the pasta. Reserve the pot.

Build the cheese sauce: Crack open 1 bottle dark beer. In the same pot you cooked the pasta in, melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, 1 minute. Sprinkle 1/3 cup all-purpose flour over the garlic and cook, whisking, for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in the beer until smooth. Whisking continuously, slowly add 1 1/2 cups heavy cream. Once incorporated, gradually add 2 cups whole milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the grated cheeses, including 2 ounces grated Parm. Stir until nearly completely melted. Add a few big spoonfuls each of Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce, about 3 tablespoons each, but taste and add them as you see fit. Season the sauce with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and lots and lots of freshly ground black pepper.

Stir the pasta into the cheese sauce, followed by the torn greens, stirring to distribute them evenly. They will cook down further in the oven. Transfer the contents of the pot to the prepared baking dish. Bake until the top is golden and beginning to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, toast the bread crumbs: In a medium skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons unsalted butter over medium-high heat. Add 1 cup panko bread crumbs and toast, stirring often, until deeply golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer the bread crumbs to a bowl and season with salt.

Finish the mac: Remove the baking dish from the oven, scatter the bread crumbs evenly over the pasta, and return the dish to the oven. Continue to bake until the top is deeply golden brown and the sauce is thick and bubbling, 12 to 16 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.`

      "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk",
      "Flaky sea salt"
    ],
    method: `Brew the coffee: Boil 1 cup water. Coarsely grind 3/4 cup whole coffee beans. Place the grounds in a glass measuring cup. Add the boiling water and stir. Let sit for 8 minutes, stirring twice. Strain the coffee through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, pressing on the solids lightly with the back of a spoon to extract 1/2 cup coffee. Chill until completely cool, about 30 minutes.

Prep the pan: Line a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on both of the long sides. Place the loaf pan in the freezer.

Whip the cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, place 3 cups heavy cream and 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt. Beat on medium-high until stiff peaks form.

Combine and freeze: Finely chop 1 cup roasted, salted peanuts. Into a large bowl, pour 1 can sweetened condensed milk. Add the cooled coffee, including any sludgy bits that have accumulated at the bottom, and whisk until smooth. Spoon a big dollop of the whipped cream into the condensed milk mixture and gently whisk to combine. Repeat twice more with 2 more big spoonfuls of the whipped cream. Switch to a rubber spatula and, in one go, add all of the remaining whipped cream and all but a small handful of the chopped peanuts. Gently fold once or twice, just ever so slightly, to incorporate.

Scrape the contents of the bowl into the prepared pan. No need to smooth the top because some irregularity here is good and will make for a nice tall slice. Sprinkle the top with the reserved peanuts. Freeze until frozen, covering the loaf lightly with plastic wrap once it has just set, about 8 hours or overnight.

Serve: When ready to serve, rub your palms around the exterior of the pan to warm the sides. Gently lift the semifreddo out of the pan using the parchment paper flaps and transfer to a serving platter or cutting board. Remove the parchment paper. Cut the loaf into slices and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Let the slices sit for a minute or two before serving.`

      "5 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus more as needed",
      "2 tablespoons mayonnaise",
      "4 brioche buns"

    method: `Do some prep: Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Salt generously and add 1/2 cup brown lentils. Cook until tender but not falling apart, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Finely chop 1 large onion. Smash and peel 3 garlic cloves. Crush 1 tablespoon coriander seeds. Using a peeler, peel strips of zest from 1 lemon. Thinly slice the strips lengthwise, then slice the strips crosswise to finely mince them.

Make the patties: In a medium skillet, heat a couple glugs of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and just beginning to turn golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Finely grate the 3 garlic cloves into the skillet. Continue to cook, stirring, until the garlic is softened and fragrant but not browned, 1 minute. Add the crushed coriander seeds, 2 teaspoons ground cumin, and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes. Add about 1 tablespoon dried mint, crumbling it finely with your fingers as you go. Saute for 1 minute. Transfer the onion mixture to the bowl with the lentils.

Open 1 can chickpeas and pour 1/4 cup of the liquid into the lentils. Drain the rest of the liquid and measure out 1/2 cup of the chickpeas. Add the chickpeas to the bowl with the lentils. Stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil and about half of the minced lemon zest. Mash the mixture with a potato masher until the lentils and chickpeas are lightly smashed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add 5 tablespoons flour and stir to incorporate. Squeeze a small handful of the mixture in your hands; it should hold together in a smooshed mass. If it crumbles, add another tablespoon of flour. Crumble 4 ounces feta into the bowl and fold to combine. Form the mixture into four patties. Chill on a small baking sheet for at least 10 minutes, or until ready to cook.

Make the very special sauce: In a medium bowl, combine 1/2 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, and the remaining chopped lemon zest. With your fingers, finely crumble in the remaining 1 tablespoon dried mint. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Prep the burger accompaniments: Split 4 brioche buns in half. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add a small glug of olive oil and swirl to coat the pan. Toast the buns in the pan until golden and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Thinly slice 2 Persian cucumbers lengthwise into planks.

Cook the burgers and build 'em: Raise the heat to medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and swirl to coat. Add the burgers and cook, undisturbed, until golden and crisp on the outside, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with any remaining burgers, adding more oil between batches. Build your burgers on the buns, each with some of the very special sauce, some sliced cucumbers, and a pile of arugula. Squeeze some lemon juice over the arugula. Top and serve.`

      "2 (10-ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed",
      "1 (14- to 17-ounce) package puff pastry, thawed overnight in the refrigerator"
    ],
    method: `Do some prep: Preheat the oven to 400F. Chop 2 medium onions. Finely chop enough fresh ginger to measure 1/4 cup. Finely chop 6 garlic cloves. Peel 2 medium sweet potatoes and cut them into 1/2-inch cubes. Drain and rinse 1 can lentils.

Start the aromatics: Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add several generous glugs of olive oil and the chopped onions and ginger and season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Saute, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic. Stir until fragrant and softened but not browned, about 1 minute.

Toast the spices and build the filling: Push the aromatics to one side and add another glug of olive oil to the empty spot. To the oil, add 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon curry powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Cook in the oil until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir the spices into the aromatics and continue cooking for another minute. Stir in 2/3 cup cold water. Add the lentils, sweet potatoes, and 2 cans full-fat coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat as needed to maintain a brisk simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching, until the sweet potatoes are just barely tender, 7 to 9 minutes.

Place 2 packages thawed chopped spinach in a kitchen towel and squeeze firmly to expel as much water as possible. Add the spinach and stir to distribute and warm through. Adjust the seasoning with kosher salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. This will need a lot of salt. Transfer the filling to a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.

Top with puff and bake: If your puff pastry comes in 2 sheets, on a lightly floured surface, unfurl one sheet, brush it lightly with melted butter, and place the second right on top, stacking them. Roll the sheets to about 10 x 14 inches, or slightly larger than the size of your baking dish. Lay the puff pastry on top of the filling. The pastry should come just over the sides of the baking dish. Press down on the pastry to allow it to slump into the dish and adhere to the inside edges, then gently fold the corners to crease and make a seal. If using one sheet, simply roll the puff pastry to a 10 x 14-inch rectangle and proceed as stated above. In a small dish, beat 1 egg. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the top of the pastry with the egg wash. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and black pepper. With a knife, cut a series of vent slits in the top of the pastry, about 2 inches in length and 2 inches apart. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350F and continue baking until the pastry is puffed and deeply golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes more. Let rest for 15 minutes before serving.`

    author: "Molly Baz",
    book: "Cook This Book",
    category: "Poultry",
    serves: "Serves 4 to 6",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "1 1/2 cups packed cilantro leaves and tender stems",
      "2 limes",
      "3 pounds chicken wings, drumettes and flats separated",
      "1 tablespoon kosher salt",
      "3 tablespoons vegetable oil",
      "1 (4-ounce) jar or can red curry paste",
      "1 (13.5-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk",
      "1 1/2 teaspoons honey or sugar",
      "Red pepper flakes (optional)",
      "1/2 cup roasted, salted peanuts"
    ],
    method: `Season the wings: Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Pat dry 3 pounds chicken wings with a paper towel. Toss the chicken wings with 1 tablespoon salt on the baking sheet until well coated. Leave at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 1/2 hours.

Roast the wings: Preheat the oven to 300F. Drizzle the wings generously with vegetable oil and toss to evenly coat. Bake for 25 minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 450F and continue to cook the wings, flipping them with tongs halfway through, until the skin is very crisp and golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.

While the wings cook, make the coconut glaze: In a medium saucepan with a lid, heat another glug of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add 1 jar red curry paste and immediately cover the pan. Cook, shaking the pan often, until you hear the violent sputtering die down, about 2 minutes, then remove the lid. Continue to cook until the paste is slightly darker and begins to stick to the pan, 2 minutes. Whisk in 1 can full-fat coconut milk and 1 1/2 teaspoons honey. Bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat as needed to maintain a simmer and cook, whisking often, until the liquid has reduced substantially and thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. If you like your wings hot, start stirring in red pepper flakes to taste. Cover the pot until the wings are ready.

Prep your garnishes: Finely chop 1/2 cup roasted, salted peanuts so all the pieces are around the size of a lentil. Coarsely chop 1 1/2 cups packed cilantro leaves and tender stems. Cut 2 limes in half.

Toss the wings: Transfer the cooked wings to a large bowl. Pour the hot coconut glaze over them and toss to coat. Add the peanuts and cilantro and toss again. Squeeze the juice of 1 lime over everything and toss once more. Transfer to a serving platter with the remaining lime halves and lots of napkins.`

    author: "Molly Baz",
    book: "Cook This Book",
    category: "Poultry",
    serves: "Serves 4",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "3 large shallots",
      "6 garlic cloves",
      "1 red Fresno chile, or 3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
      "2 ears of corn",
      "1 small bunch of mint or basil",
      "2 lemons",
      "6 tablespoons unsalted butter",
      "1 1/2 cups buttermilk",
      "2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs",
      "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "3/4 cup all-purpose flour",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil",
      "6 oil-packed anchovy fillets"
    ],
    method: `Do some prep: Thinly slice 3 large shallots, 6 garlic cloves, and 1 Fresno chile. Shuck and remove the kernels from 2 ears of corn.

Pound and dredge the chicken: Take 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs and, working with one at a time, place a thigh between 2 pieces of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin or heavy skillet to pound the chicken to a 1/2-inch thickness. Season the thighs with salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a shallow bowl, place 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. Thoroughly dredge each chicken thigh in the flour, shaking off any excess, and place on a large rimmed baking sheet.

Cook the thighs: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until hot. Add a few big glugs of olive oil and heat until you see wisps of smoke. Gently place 2 thighs in the skillet. Cook the chicken until deeply golden on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate, browned-side up, and repeat with the remaining thighs, adding more oil when needed.

Make the pan sauce: Reduce the heat to low and add 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 6 oil-packed anchovy fillets, the shallots, garlic, chile, and 6 mint sprigs. Season with salt and pepper and saute, stirring, until the aromatics are softened, about 3 minutes. Add the corn and continue cooking for 2 minutes, until just softened. Add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and adjust the heat as needed to maintain a brisk simmer. Cook, shaking the pan and stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced but still quite saucy, 3 to 4 minutes. The buttermilk will split, and you'll see small curds throughout the pan. Cube the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, add to the pan, and continue cooking, vigorously shaking the pan as you stir, until the butter is incorporated, about 2 minutes.

Cut 2 lemons in half. Divide the chicken among plates, top with the pan sauce, and serve with plenty of fresh mint and the lemon halves alongside for squeezing.`

    author: "Molly Baz",
    book: "Cook This Book",
    category: "Baking",
    serves: "Serves 6 to 8",
    time: "",
    ingredients: [
      "1 large white or yellow onion",
      "7 garlic cloves",
      "1 lemon",
      "1 1/2 ounces grated Parmigiano Reggiano",
      "8 ounces fresh whole-milk mozzarella cheese",
      "8 ounces fresh whole-milk ricotta cheese",
      "1 (16-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach or kale, thawed",
      "3 1/2 cups (420g) all-purpose flour",
      "3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast",
      "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "Extra-virgin olive oil",
      "4 large oil-packed anchovy fillets",
      "Red pepper flakes",
      "1/4 cup sesame seeds",
      "Flaky sea salt"
    ],
    method: `The day before you'd like to eat the focaccia, start the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast, and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Fill a measuring cup with 2 cups warm water and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Gradually add the water mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy and very wet dough forms. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, cover with plastic wrap, and transfer to the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to overnight.

Proof the dough: The next day, about 5 hours before you want to eat, remove the dough from the fridge. Set the oven to 350F and let it heat up for 1 to 2 minutes, until just warm. Turn off the oven and place the dough in the bowl, still covered, inside to rise until puffy, bubbling, and doubled in size, about 3 hours.

As the dough rises, do some prep: Chop 1 large onion. Peel 7 garlic cloves. Thinly slice 5 of them and reserve the other 2 for grating later. Drain 1 package chopped spinach in a colander. Squeeze and squeeze with all your might to expel as much water as possible.

Make the filling: In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and 4 large oil-packed anchovy fillets, season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and just beginning to turn golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the sliced garlic and a big pinch of red pepper flakes. Continue to cook, stirring, until the garlic is softened, about 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, to marry the flavors and cook off any remaining water, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in 1 1/2 ounces grated Parm, then grate in the remaining 2 garlic cloves and the zest of 1 lemon. Mix to combine and taste and adjust the seasoning with kosher salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Let cool.

Stuff the focaccia: When the dough has finished rising, lightly coat a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Line the baking dish generously with parchment paper and then generously oil the parchment with a few glugs of olive oil. Smear a large rubber spatula with olive oil and, in one confident movement, scrape around the bowl, tipping it over the baking dish to release the dough into the pan. Try not to disturb any bubbles that have formed in the dough. Dip your fingers in the oil that has accumulated in the baking dish and carefully dimple and stretch the dough to meet the outer edges. The dough will naturally relax and spread into the corners on its own, so don't worry if it doesn't reach the edges at this point. Using your fingers, gently pile and scatter the spinach filling over the dough, all the way to the edges. Slice 8 ounces mozzarella as thinly as possible. Distribute the mozzarella over the filling. With the oiled fingers of both hands, and working from the short end of the baking dish, confidently creep your fingers under one-half of the dough, taking hold of the underside. Lift the dough, folding it over into the center. Re-oil your fingers and repeat on the other short side, being sure to bring this second half to the middle of the dish to meet the other half of the dough, edge to edge. Pinch, seal, and poke any rogue filling back into the center or into the openings on the sides.

Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and let rise on your countertop for 30 minutes, until the dough is a bit more puffed and the indentation from an oiled fingertip springs back ever so slightly. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 450F.

Top and bake: Drizzle the top of the dough generously with olive oil, sprinkle with 1/4 cup sesame seeds, dollop with 8 ounces ricotta cheese, and season with flaky sea salt. Transfer to the oven and bake, rotating it halfway through, until the focaccia is deeply golden on the top and bottom, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. Run a metal spatula around the edges and under the focaccia to free it from the dish. Transfer to a wire rack, slide the parchment paper out from under it, and let the focaccia sit until just cool enough to handle. Slice into wedges, squares, or strips, and eat.`

Roll out the other half of the pastry dough to the same thickness as the base, and cut into 2 cm wide ribbons. Attach the ribbons of dough all the way around the edges of the spiral, pinching the dough together to seal.

Score the top of the cake filling with a fork to decorate, then press whole almonds into the top.

Bake for 50 minutes, or until the outside crust is firm. Just before serving, dust with icing sugar.`

    serves: "Serves 8",
    time: "Prep Time 15 minutes, plus overnight gelato cooling, churning and freezing; Cooking Time 1 hour 30 minutes",
    ingredients: [
      "300 g pistachio nuts, skin on",
      "6 eggs",
      "250 g caster sugar",
      "150 g butter, softened",
      "100 g potato flour starch",
      "1 teaspoon baking powder",
      "Icing sugar, for dusting",
      "500 ml milk",
      "5 egg yolks",
      "50 g honey",
      "150 g caster sugar",
      "100 g pistachio nuts, peeled",
      "150 ml single cream",
      "2 tablespoons pure pistachio paste"
    ],
    method: `To make the pistachio gelato, bring the milk to a simmer in a pan over low heat. Whisk the egg yolks, honey and sugar until thick and creamy in a heatproof bowl. Pour the milk over the egg mixture and stir until combined.

Place the heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water and, stirring regularly, bring to 85C on a pastry thermometer. This should take 15-20 minutes. The mixture should coat the back of a spoon. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a clean container and chill overnight in the fridge.

Process the pistachios in a food processor to make a fine meal. Lightly whip the cream and fold in the pistachios and pistachio paste.

Place the chilled mixture in a gelato machine and churn until just set, then add the cream and pistachio mix and churn again for 2 minutes. Transfer the gelato into a plastic or metal container and store in the freezer until ready to use.

Preheat the oven to 160C (315F).

To make the pistachio cake, grind the pistachios in a food processor to make a fine meal.

Beat the eggs with the sugar. Beat in the butter. Sift the potato flour starch with the baking powder and add to the mixture gently. Finally, stir in the pistachio meal a little at a time.

Pour the mixture into a greased and lined 26 cm round cake tin and bake for 55-60 minutes, or until fully cooked. Test by inserting a skewer into the centre of the cake: if it comes out clean, the cake is cooked. Allow the cake to cool, then remove from the tin.

Once completely cool, dust the cake with icing sugar, slice and serve with a scoop of the gelato.`

      "300 g zucchini (courgettes)",
      "5 tablespoons butter, melted",
      "200 g grated Parmigiano Reggiano"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 170C (325F). Arrange the pistachio nuts evenly on a baking tray and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until lightly browned. Take the tray out of the oven and remove the nuts from the tray to prevent them from over-colouring. Allow to cool completely.

Place the deboned duck on a baking tray, season both sides and refrigerate.

In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the red wine, orange juice, sugar, cloves, peppercorns and cinnamon to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

Cut the prunes into quarters and place in a heatproof bowl. Pour the red wine mix over the top and let it steep for at least 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 180C (350F).

Remove half the prunes from the marinade and combine with the pork mince, pistachio nuts, garlic and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the stuffing into a thick log, approximately the same length as the duck.

Remove the deboned duck from the refrigerator and place skin-side-down on a work surface, then spread open. Place the stuffing lengthways through the middle of the duck. Fold the sides over to form a cylindrical shape, tuck the ends under and, using butcher's twine, tie at even intervals along the duck.

Brush the duck with olive oil and place on a rack in a roasting tray. Roast for about 1 hour or until golden and crisp, basting every 15 minutes with its own fat.

Meanwhile, to make the potato and zucchini torta, slice the potatoes and zucchini as thinly as possible, then toss with the butter and season. In a medium-sized baking dish, layer the potato and zucchini alternately, sprinkling a little cheese between each layer. Finish with a layer of Parmigiano.

When the duck has been in the oven for 30 minutes, add the torta and bake for 40 minutes or until golden in colour.

Meanwhile, heat the remaining prunes and red wine marinade in a saucepan over low heat.

When cooked, remove the duck from the oven and cover with foil. Rest for about 10 minutes while the torta finishes cooking.

Remove the string from the duck and slice into portions. Serve with the potato and zucchini torta, the remaining prunes and the warm marinade as a sauce.`

      "1 vanilla bean, split",
      "400 g (14 oz) sour or sweet fresh cherries (if using sweet cherries, add the juice of 1 lemon to the poaching liquid)"
    ],
    method: `Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F) and boil a full kettle of water.

Melt the sugar in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until it turns a dark amber colour. Use a wooden spoon to mix it once it starts caramelising to ensure that it all melts evenly. Immediately pour the caramel into the base of a non-stick loaf (bar) tin. Whisk together the remaining ingredients and a pinch of salt in a bowl, then pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve directly onto the caramel. Cover the tin with aluminium foil and place it inside a larger baking dish. Place the dish in the oven, then pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the side of the loaf tin. Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point, check the texture: it should still be quite wobbly, but not liquid. If it is still liquid in the centre, continue cooking for another 15–20 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the water bath. Once cooled, refrigerate, still covered, overnight.

To make the poached cherries, combine the sugar, lemon peel, vanilla bean, 200 ml (7 fl oz) water and a pinch of salt in a saucepan and bring to a simmer on the stove. Pit your cherries using a cherry pitter, or push them out using a metal straw. Add the cherries to the pot and simmer until they are soft but not bursting, about 5 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve.

To unmould, cut around the sides of the custard and invert onto a flat plate. Cut slices and serve with or without the poached cherries.`

      "Reduction:",
      "60 g (2 oz) shallot, peeled and sliced",

      "1 bay leaf",
      "60 g (2 oz) dry-cured smoked bacon, diced",

      "2 g (⅛ oz) caster (superfine) sugar",
      "pinch of freshly ground white pepper",
      "pinch of ground allspice",
      "360 g (12½ oz) clarified, warm unsalted butter or ghee",
      "To finish:",
      "50 ml (1¾ fl oz) clarified butter or ghee"
    ],
    method: `Make the reduction well before making the parfait so it has time to chill. Sweat the shallot over a low heat in the oil with the bay leaf to bring out all the sweetness. Cover with baking paper or a lid, slightly ajar, and allow to sweat gently until lightly brown in colour. Add the bacon and increase the heat to medium. Let everything become golden but not dark brown or burnt. You may need to add a splash of water to prevent it catching.

Add the Madeira and reduce by two-thirds. Season with a pinch of pepper, allspice and salt. Remove the bay leaf and discard, then blend the mixture to a paste in a high-speed blender.

Pass through a fine-mesh sieve by pressing on the paste with a ladle. You will end up with approximately 75–100 ml (2½–3½ fl oz) liquid. Allow to cool, then set aside. This can be made a day or two in advance and stored in the fridge.

Before making the parfait, make sure all your ingredients, including the reduction, are slightly warm or at room temperature. The idea is to keep everything at the same temperature when mixing so as not to break the emulsion of the butter, eggs and livers.

Clean the livers very well of any sinew and weigh them. You need to end up with 400 g (14 oz) once cleaned. Blend the livers with all the remaining ingredients except the butter until smooth, then slowly add the warm butter with the machine running on low speed. Finally, add the warmed reduction and blend. Pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Pour this mixture into a 30×11 cm (12×4½ in) terrine mould and cover tightly with aluminium foil.

Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F).

Place the terrine in a deep roasting tin and pour enough water into the roasting tin to come halfway up the side of the terrine. Bake until the internal temperature of the parfait reaches 58°C (136°F) on a cooking thermometer. Remove it from the oven and water bath and leave to cool completely, then refrigerate overnight.

The following day, remove the parfait from the refrigerator and use a spoon to scrape the grey top layer away. Try to smooth the top out as much as possible. Pour the clarified butter over the top to completely cover and seal it, then refrigerate again to firm up. To serve, scoop out spoonfuls and serve with a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar and grilled sourdough or crostini, or a sharp and sweet fruit chutney.`

      "20 g (¾ oz) chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley",
      "White bean purée:",
      "1 garlic bulb",
      "2 tablespoons olive oil",
      "400 g (14 oz) freshly cooked cannellini or borlotti beans (cooking liquid reserved)"
    ],
    method: `To achieve crispy skin, you need to dry out the skin of the chicken. Refrigerate uncovered for one or two nights. If you don't have time for this, dry out the skin as best you can with paper towel. On the day you want to cook the chicken, remove it from the fridge, season with salt and leave it to come to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).

To make the white bean purée, start by cutting the top quarter off the garlic bulb. Place it on a piece of aluminium foil and pour the oil on top with a pinch of salt. Wrap the garlic in the foil and bake for 30–40 minutes until it is soft and golden. Remove from the oven, unwrap and allow to cool, being careful to reserve all the oil it was cooked in. Put the beans in a blender and blitz to a purée with some of their cooking liquid. Squeeze the soft garlic out of its skin and into the blender, along with the reserved garlic oil. Blend until smooth, then check for seasoning. Add a bit more liquid or water as needed to achieve a smooth but not runny consistency. Scrape it into a small saucepan, ready to warm up before serving.

Heat a wide cast-iron pan over a high heat. When it is very hot, add the clarified butter and place one piece of chicken, skin side down, in the pan, then reduce the heat to medium. You will need to cook the chicken one piece at a time to ensure crispiness. Place a small piece of baking paper or aluminium foil on top of the chicken and use another heavy pan to weigh it down. It will take 6–8 minutes to brown the skin. Start checking it after 5 minutes. When brown and crispy, remove the chicken from the pan and repeat the process with the other piece. To finish cooking, place both pieces of chicken back in the pan, flesh side down, and cook for another 3–4 minutes until just cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and allow to rest. Discard the remaining oil, then add 30 ml (1 fl oz) water to the pan and deglaze, scraping all the bits from the bottom. Use this as a pan sauce. Set aside.

Clean the pan and set over a medium heat. Brown the butter until golden, fragrant and foamy. Immediately throw in the capers and sizzle in the butter. Add the lemon pieces and parsley.

To serve, place a bit of the warmed purée on the base of each plate and top with the chicken. Spoon some of the pan sauce on top and, finally, spoon over the butter caper sauce. Serve immediately.`

    author: "Danielle Alvarez",
    book: "Always Add Lemon",
    serves: "4-6",
    time: "1 hr + overnight",
    category: "Pork",
    ingredients: [
      "1.25 kg (2 lb 12 oz) pork rack, bone in, skin on",
      "8 g (¼ oz) sage leaves",
      "10 g (¼ oz) salt",
      "5–6 sweet apples, cored and quartered",
      "1 teaspoon dijon mustard",
      "1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard",
      "2 tablespoons crème fraîche"
    ],
    method: `To prepare the pork rack for roasting, score the skin in thin narrow lines from top to bottom. You want to cut through the fat, but not into the flesh. This will allow the fat to melt out and the skin to blister. If your kitchen knife isn't super sharp, a small serrated knife makes this job easy.

Next, make your sage salt by crushing the leaves and salt together in a mortar and pestle until you get something that is almost paste-like in consistency. Rub the sage salt around the flesh of the pork, but not the skin. Crack black pepper on the meat as well, then sprinkle plain sea salt on the skin and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight.

The next day, remove your pork from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F).

Place the pork, skin side up, on a tray lined with baking paper. Roast for about 20 minutes, then add the apples to the tray and turn to coat them in a bit of the rendered pork fat. Roast for another 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature at the thickest part of the meat reads between 58–65°C (136–149°F). At this stage, place your roast under the grill (broiler) for a minute or two, but do not walk away from it. This last little blast of heat will make any last bit of skin blister and puff into crackling, but it can burn very easily. Remove it from the oven and place on a chopping board. Let it rest for at least 15 minutes while you finish the sauce.

Remove the apples from the roasting tray and pour off the juices and fat into a small saucepan. Set over a medium heat and add the mustards and crème fraîche. Bring to a simmer, then check for seasoning and set aside.

Cut the pork rack in between the bones into chops. Serve one warm chop per person with a few wedges of apple. Finally, spoon a generous tablespoon of warm sauce on top of each chop and serve straight away. A little sprinkle of salt on top of the sliced meat is also a good idea.`
